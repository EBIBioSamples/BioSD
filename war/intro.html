						<div>The <strong>BioSample Database</strong> at the EBI is a new database designed to hold information about biological samples that are referenced from other EBI databases. We have started populating the database with information about commonly reused samples or sample sources such as common cell lines. Samples are assigned accession numbers which are referenced by links from other databases e.g ArrayExpress, PRIDE and ENA. BioSD data will be exchanged with <a href="documents/BioSampleDB_EBI_NCBI.pdf">NCBI</a>
